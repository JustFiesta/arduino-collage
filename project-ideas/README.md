# Arduino Projects

## Level 1 – Basics (a few hours)
  1. Blinking LED – the first step in Arduino (learning the blink sketch).
  2. Mini traffic lights – 3 LEDs + a button to change the lights.
  3. Thermometer with a temperature sensor – read sensor data and display it in the serial monitor.
  4. Light sensor (LDR) + LED – LED turns on when the room gets dark.
  5. Mini sound alarm – buzzer beeps when a button is pressed or motion is detected.

## Level 2 – Intermediate projects (a few days)
  1. Weather station – temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor + LCD display.
  2. Simple password lock – numeric keypad + LED/buzzer as feedback for the correct code.
  3. Automatic plant watering – soil moisture sensor + water pump.
  4. Distance sensor (ultrasonic) – e.g., distance meter with a display.
  5. Mini alarm system – PIR motion sensor + buzzer + warning LED.
  6. Light tracker (solar tracker) – servo + photoresistors, panel rotates towards light.
  7. Simple driving robot – 2 motors + distance sensor to avoid obstacles.
  8. Noise level meter – microphone + LEDs showing loudness.
  9. Simple step counter (pedometer) – accelerometer + display for step count.

## Level 3 – Larger projects (up to a week)
  1. Smart RGB lamp controlled via phone – Bluetooth module + RGB LEDs.
  2. Remote IoT thermometer – Arduino + Wi-Fi module (ESP8266/ESP32) sending data to phone/cloud.
  3. Mini weather station with display and SD card logging – weather sensors + SD card.
  4. Line-following robot – robot follows a black line (infrared sensors + 2 motors).
  5. Home “smart station” – temperature, light, and motion sensors + relays to control lamps.
  6. RFID card lock – open a door using an RFID card instead of a key.
